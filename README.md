## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of a credit card customer defaulting in the next month using advanced machine learning techniques. The solution is designed to help financial institutions proactively identify high-risk customers and reduce potential losses.

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify trends and patterns.
- **Feature Engineering** including domain-specific financial metrics.
- **Handling Imbalanced Data** with SMOTE.
- **Model Training & Tuning** with Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Stacking Ensembles.
- **Threshold Optimization** to maximize F2-score.
- **Final Deployment-Ready Model** optimized for recall.

## ðŸ“Š Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance
- **Primary Metric:** F2-score (focus on recall for defaulter detection)
- **Best Model:** Tuned LightGBM
- **F2-score:** High recall with balanced precision.
